Term 3- DV 200 (E-commerce Website)
SoleBox
DV200 MERN STACK | INTERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT 200 | TERM 3
About the Project
Project Description
In this term, we embarked on a journey into the world of Full Stack web development, with a primary focus on seamlessly integrating Front End and Back End technologies to create a comprehensive web application.
Our task was to build upon the skills acquired during Term One and Two by implementing a Single Page Architecture (SPA) style application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
For this project, I chose to create an eCommerce website, specialising in footwear, known as "SoleBox."

Built With
Node.js
Visual Studio Code
React
JavaScript
CSS
JSX
Express.js
MongoDB
Mongoose
Joi
JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Bootstrap
Axios
React-Router-Dom
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To get started with SoleBox, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
Visual Studio Code
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
Node.js
How to Install
		Install Visual Studio Code from Visual Studio Code.
		Download and install a modern web browser like Google Chrome.
		Install Node.js from Node.js.
After you have installed the prerequisites, follow these steps:
		Open Visual Studio Code (VSC) in a folder where you want to create the SoleBox app.
		Run the following command inside the terminal in VSC to create a React app:
bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app .
Alternatively, you can specify the application name:
bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app SoleBox
		Once the app is created, install the required dependencies using these commands:
bash
Copy code
npm i axios npm i bootstrap react-bootstrap npm i react-router-dom
		Start the application by running:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Features and Functionality
SoleBox offers the following features and functionality:
A captivating landing page with introductory information, a slider, and a product showcase.
A product catalogue page with filtering options for easy navigation.
User registration and login modals for a personalised shopping experience.
A shopping cart page to manage selected items.
Inventory management for seamless product management.
An order processing page to handle customer orders.
An "Add Product" page for adding new products to the catalogue.
Development Process
Implementation Process
Highlights
React's efficiency in updating the DOM due to its object-oriented nature.
The clean and reusable approach of breaking up the web application into components.
Effective use of Axios for making API calls and handling promises for data retrieval.
The simplicity and cleanliness of routing for navigating between pages and components, reducing code redundancy.
Challenges
Understanding asynchronous programming and mastering Async/Await for handling asynchronous tasks.
Navigating and working with the Node.js server presented a learning curve.
Future Implementations
In the future, I plan to enhance SoleBox by:
Expanding the product range with a more diverse selection.
Adding additional filtering options to the product catalogue page for improved user experience.
Conclusion
Developing the SoleBox SPA web application from scratch has been an exhilarating journey. While this project presented its fair share of challenges, I successfully conquered most of them, and I take immense pride in the final outcome of my Sneaker eCommerce web application.
Working with my own Node server was both challenging and enlightening, providing valuable insights into server-side development. Furthering my React skills and incorporating technologies like Axios, routing, and component-based development have been particularly rewarding. I have a strong inclination towards using components and routing in my future projects.
The knowledge gained throughout this term will undoubtedly serve as a solid foundation for my future web application endeavours.
